 Process lock
==============

Fasteners inter-process locks are cross-platform and are released automatically
if the process crashes. They are based on the platform specific locking
mechanisms:

* fcntl for posix (Linux and OSX)
* LockFileEx (via pywin32) and \_locking (via msvcrt) for Windows

The intersection of fcntl and LockFileEx features is quite small, hence you
should always assume that:

* Locks are advisory. They do not prevent the modification of the locked file
  by other processes.

* Locks can be unintentionally released by simply opening and closing the file
  descriptor, so lock files must be accessed only using provided abstractions.

* Locks are not reentrant_. An attempt to acquire a lock multiple times can
  result in a deadlock or a crash upon a release of the lock.

* Reader writer locks are not upgradeable_. An attempt to get a reader's lock
  while holding a writer's lock (or vice versa) can result in a deadlock or a
  crash upon a release of the lock.

* There are no guarantees regarding usage by multiple threads in a
  single process. The locks work only between processes.
